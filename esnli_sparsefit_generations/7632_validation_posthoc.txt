Predicted: entailment | the woman in a white skirt and training bra is the same person as the woman in the parking lot.  Entailment is a type of logical relation between two propositions of a formal language. The formal language is a language whose symbols are drawn from a set whose members are called its alphabet and whose operations are called its grammar. In this case, the formal language is the set of English sentences, and the grammar is the set of rules of English grammar. The set of English sentences is called the domain of discourse. For any sentence A and sentence B, we say that A entails B, written A B, if and only if there is some sentence C such that A and B are both true if and only if C is true. That is, A B if and only if for every sentence C, if A and B are both true, then C is true. The notion of entailment is an abstraction that generalizes the idea that if one thing is a certain way, then another thing is a certain way. For example, if it is raining, then the sidewalk is wet. This is an instance of entailment. Another example of entailment is
