Predicted: neutral | not all crowds watching two shirtless men perfom a dramatic performance of MacBeth are watching it. some might be watching a football game. Allen (1995) argues that there are three ways to test a hypothesis: the null hypothesis, the alternative hypothesis, and the critical value. The null hypothesis, written as H0, states that there is no difference between the mean scores of two or more groups. The alternative hypothesis, written as H1, states that there is a difference between the mean scores of two or more groups. The critical value is the value of the test statistic that corresponds to a specific level of significance. For example, a critical value of.84 at the.05 level of significance indicates that there is a 5 percent probability of obtaining a test statistic as large as or larger than.84 if the null hypothesis is true. If the test statistic is larger than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. If the test statistic is smaller than the critical value, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. In this chapter, we use a one-sample t test to test the
