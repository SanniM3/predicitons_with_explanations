Classmate:: I don't like riding the bus because of all of the poor people. Me:: Wow.  I'm a poor person.  And I ride the bus every day. Classmate, somewhat awkwardly:: You don't count, everyone in college is poor. This happened during my first year of college.  I was completely supported by grants and loans, because my family had only managed to make $200 the year before... and is still poor now. In 2008, at University of California Berkeley. Made me feel angry, disgusted.
